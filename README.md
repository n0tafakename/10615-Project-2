# 10615-Project-2
Code and Results from Style Transfer Nerf Exploration.

The basic idea of this project was to explore how 2d style transfer on NeRF training data impacts the rendering of the object.
We used https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp for Nerf.
For style transfer, we used STROTSS https://github.com/futscdav/strotss.
